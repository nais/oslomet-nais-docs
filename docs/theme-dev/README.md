# Docs's theme development
There is need for documentation that is WCAG compilant, but currently no theme for MkDocs fullfil this requrest. Therefore the goal of this project is to create such. 

Prototype of WCAG compliant Mkdocs theme is currently being developed for this docs (NAIS). It is based on MkDocs theme that has been modified. The base theme is Cinder theme. [Cinder theme for MkDocs](https://sourcefoundry.org/cinder/) 

## Documentation for this project
Relevant documenatation for this project exist under section "theme-dev" (this/current section). Beside this page, it does consist of some additional pages such as:

- *User guide* - contains relevant information for users of this project's prototype. 
- *Developer guide* - contains relevant information regardless developing this projects's prototype. 
- *Sandbox* - is testing area for this project. 

!!! note
    this documentation has nothing to do with the orginal nais documentation. Scope of this documentation is only the modification of the theme.

### Future of this documentation
For now this docs will nicely live here together with the nais documentation. It is mainly because we don't know what we will do with it in the future. At the same time we need documentation and it is convinient to have it here. It is written in markdown and contained in one folder which will make it easy to move it to other places.

## Todo next
This project has a long way to go before one can say it is finished. Below, there is a list of next things to do.

- markdown of main content need to be WCAG compliant
- mechanisms to make textual content accessible needs to be developed/implemented
