# Docs's theme development
Prototype of WCAG compliant Mkdocs theme is currently being developed for this docs (NAIS). This is because there is no WCAG compliant themes that can be used while documentation has to meet these guidlines.

## What is this?
This is documentation section for theme development for this docs. It is not connected by any means to the orginal nais platform docs.

## Why does it exists?
We need documentation for theme modification we currently are working on. In addition this section of the docs will provide us a testing area, where we can test whatever we need to test.

## Future
For now this docs will nicely live here together with the nais documentation. It is mainly because we don't know what we will do with it in the future. At the same time we need documentation and it is convinient to have it here. It is written in markdown and contained in one folder which will make it easy to move it to other places.
