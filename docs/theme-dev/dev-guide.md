# Developer guide

Things the folks after us need to know

## Css structure
Css for this theme is divided into 3 "levels", basicly there are 3 different stylesheet where one can provide changes. 
Those are: 

- bootstrap 
- base 
- cinder

**bootstrap** - bootstrap file that provides backbone. 

**base** - this is where extension to bootstrap are made, or definisions of sets i.e alerts styles

**cinder** - "local" changes that controlls cinder looks. So this is where i.e color of headers is set.

**highlight.css** - this is file that contains styles for hljs (code snippets syntax highlighter). In terms of level, this one is equal with base.

You can alter this in any way you want.
