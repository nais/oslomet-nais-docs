# Documentation for Cinder changes
Cinder is the theme you are currently seeing. As other themes for mkdocs, it does have its own documentation. However we intend to modify this theme and therefore the changes will be documented here.

## Favicon
In order to use custom favicon use following config entry:
```
theme: 
    favicon: path/to/icon
```
If no favicon is specified in config file, default icon located under `cinder/img/favicon.ico` will be used instead.
